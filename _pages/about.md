# Saurabh Kumar

Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a Research Associate at the [SPIRE Lab, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://spirlab.github.io/), where I work under the guidance of Prof. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh. My research focuses on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech synthesis for low-resource Indian languages. I explore tasks such as dialect and domain identification to enhance ASR models and develop efficient pipelines for data curation and quality assessment.

I hold a B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Patna. My capstone project involved simulating hybrid plasmonic waveguide-based devices using COMSOL Multiphysics.

## Research Highlights

- **ASR Development:** Developing ASR systems for agriculture and finance domains, focusing on dialectal variations in Indian languages.  
- **Speech Synthesis:** Contributed to building a text-to-speech system for nine Indian languages as part of the SYSPIN project.  
- **Data Curation:** Led efforts to curate extensive multilingual speech and text corpora for the VAANI project, funded by Google.

## Skills

I am proficient in machine learning toolkits like PyTorch and Scikit-learn, and ASR frameworks such as ESPnet, Kaldi, and Fairseq. I also have experience with programming languages like Python, Bash, and PHP.

## Publications and Projects

I have co-authored several papers on topics ranging from robust children’s speech recognition to dialectal speech processing in Indian languages. Additionally, I have actively contributed to challenges like the LIMMITS’24, MADASR, and Gram Vaani ASR, showcasing my expertise in curating datasets and building baseline models.
