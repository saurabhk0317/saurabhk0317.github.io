## Saurabh Kumar

I am currently a junior research fellow at SPIRE Lab, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Prior to that I received my B.Tech. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Nation Institute of Technology Patna, in 2020. Since the final year of my bachelor's degree, I have been working on various topics in the area of speech processing. This research experience has motivated me to expand my knowledge further and apply it in solving real-world problems. My research interests include speech recognition, speaker recognition, and deep learning.
